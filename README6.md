PMR: Pythagorean Theorem -- I had a hard time figuring out how to adjust the range 
on the Math.random function. Eventually I found the solution and applied it to my code.
Other than this, my other parts of code were relatively simple. Calculations for the 
hypotenuses were just applying simple operations to the variables.
